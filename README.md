## General Information
- To identify drivers of default or any pattern which helps in making better lending decisions at Lending Club
- We use Exploratory Data Analysis techniques such as univariate, bivariate analysis to identify the drivers

## Objectives

- Lending Club loan portfolio is used for the analysis


## Conclusions
- Drivers of default are DTI, Revolving Utilization Rate, Derogatory Public Records, Number of inquiries in last 6 months and Home owership

## Recommednations
- Lending club should apply a cap on the loan amounts based on rating grades. Higher loans should not be funded for risky customers.
- Pricing can be improved for loans with risky attributes such as high DTI and other identified driving factors
